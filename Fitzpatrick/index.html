<h2 class="nomar nopad bmar-h"> Where we are </h2>
<p>Beijing, the home base of our operation was the location of today's tasting. Beijing is like the Washington D.C. of China. It is recognized as the political, educational, and cultural center of China. The cultural history and importance of Beijing when compared to other cities around the world is near unparalleled. As with any other city in China, the traffic was most of the day at a stand still, but Beijing tops the list as far as packed and crowded cities goes. We surveyed a couple of accounts around Beijing and saw a couple of things: a) the importance of gift sets b) how much the market still has to mature. A store buyer spoke especially with the Chinese new year approaching that customers were coming into the store and wanting to buy a gift set to give to a client, friend, or family member. Fancy gift sets he said were essential to good sales for wine all during the year as well. The market is made up of consumers who don't know much about wine at all. This may be true still in the U.S. but the level of education and knowledge is much less here. Customers just know French wines for the most part and don't know what they are buying most of the time, just a price and whatever the store owner tells them. This shows the importance of having good relationships with store owners so he will hand sell our product instead of another.  This also shows the importance of more tastings and general wine education especially from other regions other than France. We also see a need for a general advertising campaign for California wines in general. This is something we think down the line could be very beneficial.</p>

<h2>The Audience</h2>
<p>This tasting was a bit quicker but contained a lot of members of the government who mentioned before have a lot of influence and are important to get in front of as they are very influential especially in the business world. A lot of the bottles were given more as gifts as the Chinese New Year is fast approaching but we tried Cabernet & Pinot Noir. This group knew wines fairly well, so fewer explanations were required and more simply enjoying the wine, which was accomplished.</p>
<h2>Immediate Reaction</h2>
<img class="fltrt lpad" src="../resources/images/tastings/012111/beijing.jpg" />
<p>The audience didn't react as positively to the Pinot Noir, but said that it wanted a little more body in a wine. They enjoyed the elegance of the Cru PN but were used to drinking heavier body wines and weren't accustomed to the lighter taste of the Pinot Noir. One thing that I'm still not used to in China is there tendency to chug their wine. The custom is to chant "Ganbei!" which means bottoms up and cheers their glasses and chug whatever drink they are drinking.  It makes it difficult to truly taste the wine by drinking this way but regardless we still received positive feedback especially about the Cabernet. The body and complexity of the Cabernet is something the audience really resonated with. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although this tasting was a little bit shorter, it was still very effective. All the participants enjoyed themselves and despite chugging the wine were able to speak about it with good observations and clarity. The cultural barrier is one that will have to be overcome along with education. This will come over time but as long as the basic appreciation for wine is there, there is success to be had!</p>

<h2 class="nomar nopad bmar-h"> Where we are </h2>

<p>Still in Shijuazhuang, but with a different set of buyers and tasters. The city never seems to die down as there is always traffic and people on the streets. The malls are packed and full of shops and activity. On the whole, it's a very active city.</p>
<img class="bmar-h" src="../resources/images/tastings/012111/tasting3.jpg" />
<h2>The Audience</h2>
<p>This tasting was a little different in that it had a potential big buyers and also some famous actors, singers, and performance artists. We believe influential people like this help in the long run and if we have their support for the wines, it can be very beneficial. With so many personalities at the dinner, you can imagine that it was very lively and fun.</p>

The body and complexity of the Cabernet is something the audience really resonated with. The Fitzpatrick Cabernet in particular sat well with audience as they were used to much weaker Cabernets originating from China so a California full Cabernet was really much appreciated. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The tasting went well, and was more of a business meeting than anything as we discussed prices, the buyer's expectations and concerns.  The actors and performers liked the wine and were vivacious throughout the dinner. The buyers main concern was the price and also the timeliness of receiving the wines. As almost any buyer he wants a high quality wine for a good price. We believe that we can offer that to him.</p>

<h2>Immediate Reaction</h2>
<p>Again we only tried Cabernets, and we also had a chance to try some Chinese Cabernet wine that one of the tasters had brought. The tasters commented on the full body that the wine had, and how pretty the wine itself looks. Some were not used to the taste and commented that it looks prettier than it actually tastes. Some also said it was drier than the Chinese wine and more complex. Personally, I thought the Chinese Cabernet (wine was called Great Wall) was extremely light. It tasted like they had some wine and then put some water in it. To be fair it retailed for about 80 RMB ($12) but just shows that the Chinese have a long way to go in their wine production. The buyer present really liked the wine and wants to put an order together soon. I will send an email detailing some more details regarding that.</p>

<h2 class="nomar nopad bmar-h"> Where we are </h2>
                        <p> Today's tasting was in Shijiazhuang, which is still in the Hebei province, which is about four hours southwest of Beijing. It contains the Shijiazhuang metropolitan area, which consists of a population of 9.6 million. The size of these potential markets continues to astonish me. The first thing that I noticed when I walked into the hotel was the poor "French" wine that we tasted the night before our first tasting. I'm not sure whether it was fraudulent or not, but in either case they have a good job with their penetration. This also tells me that there is room and potential for a better quality wine to join it on the shelves. That is the general theme that I am taking from seeing each city is that each is ripe with potential. I also see lots of adds for red wine on billboards, which shows me that the seeds are in place for continued growth.
</p>

<h2>The Audience</h2>
<p>This tasting was a little more intimate and informal and accordingly we poured less wines, only trying Cabernets. The audience consisted of restaurant owners and some writers from the press. They were a little more advanced in their wine knowledge, as their feedback was more focused and they were able to recognize finer elements of the wine. One taster commented that he had a personal collection of thirty French wines in his house, but still seemed impressed with what we poured. I took them through the basics of wine and afterwards gathered some feedback about it. We also celebrated the birthday of one of the tasters, Gir, complete with a butchered version of "Happy Birthday" and some birthday cake.</p>
<h2>Immediate Reaction</h2>

<p>The audience liked the Cabernet's and commented that while although it has less alcoholic content than Chinese wine (which tastes almost like vodka to me) it had a lot more body and fullness than what they were used to.  Another comparison that we heard from the last tasting is that drinking the wine is like entering a beautiful garden. One man commented that it made him feel warm and lovely in the chest. All agreed that the wine would do well in the country and were excited to receive it. However one commenter mentioned that the label could be a little more "Chinese" friendly.  Which means more colors that are friendly to the culture and images that connotate a high end wine for the Chinese market. I think together with our contacts in China we can work together to achieve the look he is referring to.</p>
<img class="fltrt bmar-h" src="../resources/images/tastings/012111/shijiazhunag.jpg" />
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall the tasting went well. We received some really good feedback and again took away some really great contacts and relationships. This group seemed to react to the price more positively saying that it was not too expensive so that it was unattainable but also not too cheap so that it is not devalued. This tasting was more of a conversation (as much as it could be with the language barrier) but still yielded some great results. The informal nature was pleasant with us still being able to get all of the contact information we needed. Again, we reiterated the importance of California wines and in particular CA's Cabernet Sauvignons. Everyone enjoyed themselves, and by the end, everyone was standing and giving cheers to the great wine and event.</p>
 <p>If you have any questions, please feel free to email me. I will email you again after the next tasting.</p>

            <hr class="bmar-h" />
            <h2 class="nomar nopad bmar-h"> Where we are </h2>
            <p> Today's tasting was in Langfang, which is in the Hebei province of China, about a hour south of Beijing. By China's standards it is a small city of about 3.5 million, which speaks to the incredible population in China. Langfang is known as China's Silicon Valley with emphasis on its computers and technology. The wine industry is in its infant stages with most people only knowing French wines, which seemed to have saturated the market. However, we tried some French wine the day before our tasting and it was of very poor quality. We were told this was due to Chinese wine fraudulently being labeled French. Most of the Chinese people only know what they are told and if it is a French Label with an older vintage, they automatically think it is a good bottle of wine; even if its actually poor quality Chinese red wine. This is why we believe that these tastings are very important to a) educate buyers about wine in general and b) taste them on high quality California wines.

        <h2 class="nomar nopad emar-h">The Audience</h2>
        <p>The audience was lively, and excited to try wines from the United States. The audience consisted of retail owners, restaurant buyers, and government officials. As you might know business and the government are very closely tied together in China so it is important to have government officials on our side and also informed of what we are doing. We started with general information about the wine, basics with vocabulary of wine, basic food pairings, and finally how to taste wine. Since I'm not personally well versed in Chinese (yet) we had our translator present to relay what I was saying. The audience had basic knowledge about wine, so I was glad to be able to build upon their base and take them through the tasting.</p>

      <h2 class="nomar nopad emar-h">Immediate Reaction</h2>
      <img class="fltrt lpad-h" src="../resources/images/tastings/012111/fitzpatrick.jpg" />
      <p>We had three types of wine being poured at the tasting, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Pinot Noir. The audience reacted strongly to the Pinot Noir in particular. They also enjoyed the Merlot, but the Cabernets were the least popular. We were told that English to Chinese translations of "Cabernets" have good connotations in the Chinese language. In particular the people present at the tasting enjoyed the Fitzpatrick Cabernet, and commented on how it is fuller bodied than the Merlot and Pinot Noir. After all the wines were tasted we asked for the audiences favorite and unfortunately none of the Cabernets faired well. We believe that is because a lot of the wine tasters present are still beginning to drink wine and aren't accustomed to the fuller body and more sophistication of a Cabernet Sauvignon. We are optimistic that when we move to bigger cities like Beijing the audience will be a little more familiar with Cabernets and will take more of a liking to them. The audience was notably more female so that is also a possible explanation why the lighter bodied wines faired better.
</p>

     <h2 class="nomar nopad emar-h"> Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Overall we were pleased with the wine tasting. Our two main goals of education and exposure to high quality Californian wines were accomplished. Obviously the end goal of wine sales is next and we believe that we built very beneficial relationships with buyers to put that in place. When we told them the prices of some of the wines, some in the audience seemed to become uncomfortable. We were told by our translator that they are used to buying wine for ¥30, which is $4.55. This is part of the reason that our two goals are so important because in order to overcome hurdles such as these, we have to show the Chinese people what a high quality wine tastes like. We have to demonstrate how much wine can be enjoyed and also why they should be willing to pay a higher price for wine. This shows some of our challenges in this market, but we remain patient and know that one step at a time, one tasting at a time, progress will be made and the sales will come. After their initial reaction we spoke more and explained why the wine is more expensive than what they normally see in the marketplace and they began to see how having legal wine in their establishment is beneficial to all parties. The second aspect we explained is that wines from California are some of the most coveted in the world and the wines we are pouring are the best. At the end of the tasting there were smiles all around with red wine stains on their teeth. We believe that the enjoyment they experienced and the pleasure they had from drinking the wine showed them why they should pay a little bit more for a high quality and authentic wine. We took down contact information, passed out our business cards and will be in touch with these potential buyers.
