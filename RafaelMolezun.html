        <p>Industry experts agree that China's wine market is ripe with potential. Accessing this often complex and  confusing marketplace is typically the issue.

         <h2 class="nomar nopad emar-h"> Quinta De Ventozelo</h2>
 <p>Currently in China there is an opportunity for wines from Portugal. We have found that in particular your wine resonates with the palettes in Beijing. The round, full and rich taste profile has impressed so much that we are seeking 50 cases of your Tinto DOC 2003 for immediate shipment. We already have channels that are awaiting this shipment and would like to proceed with this immediately. We would like to know pricing, your vintage restraints in regards to quantity and your ability to provide appropriate quantities. We know that sometimes quantity can be an issue, so this is one of our main concerns. We hope that this initial shipment can help foster a relationship that will grow and flourish.</p>
